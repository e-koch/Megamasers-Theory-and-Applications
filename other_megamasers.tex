\section{Other megamaser detections}
\label{sec:other}

While the vast majority of detections and observational effort has focussed on detecting OH and H$_2$O mega-masers, upgrades to some radio telescopes have lead to the first detections of CH$_3$OH and SiO mega-masers \citep{wang2014_SiO_CH3OH, chen_methanol_2015}. Both of these species have widespread galactic emission: SiO masers are associated with circumstellar material around late-type stars, and CH$_3$OH masers are commonly observed in star-forming regions of dense molecular gas \citep{Elitzur_1992}.

The first, and only, H$_2$CO mega-maser was reported by \citet{baan1986} towards XXX.

These detections will likely spur further surveys for further detections of these masing species. New discoveries should be expected...
