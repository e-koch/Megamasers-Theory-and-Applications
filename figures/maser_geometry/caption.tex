\label{fig:geometry} Beaming is shown in a filamentary geometry. Black represents the light ray, entering from the right and emerging on the right. Saturated maser emitting regions are shown in grey, while the unsaturated areas are in white. The exponential intensity gain in the unsaturated core leads to the beaming effect.
