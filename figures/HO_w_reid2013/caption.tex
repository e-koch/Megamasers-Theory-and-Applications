\label{fig:h20_H0_w} Constraints on the dark energy parameter $w$ are shown for the WMAP7 results (grey contour), the \citet{reid2013_mmproject_IV} results combined with WMAP7 (broken red contours), and the constraints expected when the completed MCP results are combined with WMAP7 (dotted blue contours). This figure is from Figure 7 of \citet{reid2013_mmproject_IV}.
