\label{fig:oh_limits} Sensitivity constraints derived by \citet{darling2002_lumfunc} for detecting OH mega-masers as a function of redshift. While the GMRT and LOFAR may provide some limited detections (with significant observing time), the SKA will make a significant region of the OH mega-maser parameter space observable within very short observational times (note that this assumes use of the full SKA). This figure is from \citet{darling2002_lumfunc} (see Figure 4).
