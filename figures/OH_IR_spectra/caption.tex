\label{fig:oh_ir_spectra} Medianed low-resolution spectra are shown for the source searched by \citet{willett2011_II}. The black spectra is the median for all 51 OH mega-masers sources, while the red is the median from the non-maser hosts. Hosts of OH mega-masers have distinctly deeper absorption features around 9.7 \& 18 $\mu$m. The continuum is also steeper towards the lower wavelengths in maser hosts.
