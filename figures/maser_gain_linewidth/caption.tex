\label{fig:maser_lwidth} An example of gain and linewidth of a maser is shown (\S\ref{sub:line_narrow}). The gain (dotted line) shows the exponential gain in the unsaturated state (Equation \ref{eq:unsat_solution}) and the transition to a linear gain once it becomes saturated (Equation \ref{eq:sat_solution}). The linewidth, normalized by the thermal linewidth $\Delta \nu_D$, is shown by the solid line, shows the behaviour explained in \S\ref{sub:line_narrow}. Figure from \citet{2004tra..book.....R} (see Figure 16.2).
