\label{fig:ohm_IR_CO} IR luminosity versus CO line luminosity for the galaxies studied in \citet{Darling_2007}. Solid circles and squares are galaxies with detected OH mega-masers. The solid line is the fit by \citet{Gao_2004}, which describes observational results over many orders of magnitude. \citet{Darling_2007} find that OH mega-maser hosts are distinct outliers to this relationship.
